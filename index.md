## Using the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}
{: #as-service}

To use the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service, complete the following steps:

1. On {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}  Dashboard, click *Add a service or API*, and then select the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service from the DevOps section in the service catalog. A new window is displayed to present an overview of the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service.
2. Select the application that you want to bind the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service to, and click *Create*. <br/>
*Remember:* You can bind only ONE {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service to an application. If the application is already bound with another {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service, do not select the application in this step. Otherwise, you will get the CWSCV2004E error.<br/>The Restage Application window is displayed.
3. In the Restage Application window, click *Restage* to restage your application before you use the new {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service that you just added. <br/><ul><li>For Liberty application, the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} is auto-configured and ready for use after the application restage.</li> <li>For Node.js or Swift applications, you must update your application code to enable the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service before pushing the application to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. See [Configuring Node.js apps with the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service](index.html#node-asagent) or [Configuring Swift apps with the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service](index.html#swift-asagent) for more details.</ul><br/> 
After restaging application is completed, you can start to configure the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service for your application.
4. To configure the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} for an application, in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} user interface, click your application that the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service is bound to.
5. In the services section on the Dashboard, click the *Auto-Scaling* icon.
6. If you have not done so, define the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} policy for the application by clicking *Create {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} Policy*.

Now you can configure the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} policy, see the metric statistics, or view the scaling history for the application.
<dl>
<dt>Policy Configuration</dt>
<dd>Use this section to create or edit the scaling rules to specify the conditions in which certain scaling activities are to be triggered.<ul>
<li> For Liberty for Java™ applications, you can define scaling rules for Heap, Memory, Response Time, and Throughput.
<li> For Node.js applications, you can define scaling rules for Heap, Memory, and Throughput.
<li> For Swift applications, you can define scaling rules for Memory, Throughput and Response Time.
<li> For Ruby applications, you can define scaling rules for Memory.</ul>
*Note:* You can define multiple scaling rules for more than one metric type. However, the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service does not detect conflicts between scaling policies. When you define the scaling policy, you must ensure that multiple scaling rules do not conflict with one another. Otherwise, you might see the total instance number fluctuates because the application scales in 1 minute and scales out the next.<br/><br/>
If the workload of your application changes dramatically during the peak time and the spare time, you can create a scaling schedule to handle the different scaling requirements for different time periods. Use the Minimum Instance Count parameter that is specified in a schedule to define the baseline of the application instance number, while dynamic scaling rules still apply to the schedule to trigger the scaling in and scaling out actions.</dd>
<dt>Metric Statistics</dt>
<dd>Displays the metric statistics for the instances of your application. You can see the average statistics and select specific instance to see its statistic.</dd>
<dt>Scaling History</dt>
<dd>Displays the scaling history of your applications.<ul>
<li> Past Week: Displays the scaling history for the past week.
<li> Past Month: Displays the scaling history for the past month.
<li> Custom Range: You can set the time period.</ul>
*Note:* You can filter the history record by selecting Scaling Status or Scaling In/Out.</dd>

## Configuring Node.js apps with the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service
{: #node-asagent}

To enable the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service with your Node.js apps, besides service provision and binding steps, you need to complete the following steps as well before pushing the app to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.
1. Enable `blumix-autoscaling-agent` in your application.
  + Update the package.json to create a dependency entry for `blumix-autoscaling-agent`. For example:<br/> 
  `"dependencies": {
    "bluemix-autoscaling-agent": "*"
  }`.<br/>
2. Start `blumix-autoscaling-agent` with your application.
There are two ways to start the agent.
  + The first way is to update the package.json file, adding `"start": "node -r bluemix-autoscaling-agent  app.js"` to the `scripts` section. For example:<br/>
  ```
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node -r bluemix-autoscaling-agent app.js"
  }
  ```
  + The second way is to update your main file to add the agent declaration `var as_agent = require('bluemix-autoscaling-agent');`. In this way, please note that you must call `require('bluemix-autoscaling-agent');` before the require statements for any npm modules you want to monitor. `bluemix-autoscaling-agent` must be initialized first so that it can instrument modules for monitoring as they are loaded.<br/>
  The following code snippet shows a complete entry js file with the auto-scaling agent declaration.<br/>
  ```
  var agent = require('bluemix-autoscaling-agent');
  var http = require('http');
  var server = http.createServer(function handler(req, res) {
    console.log("Hello!");
    
    }).listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);
  console.log('App is listening on port 3000');
  ```
You can choose either of the two ways.<br/>

3. (Optional) Set heap limit within the `scripts` section based on the memory that you allocate for your app, for example `"start": "node --max-old-space-size=600 app.js"`. .<br/>*Note:* Set a value for `max-old-space-size` if you want to trigger scaling based on heap usage. If the value is not set when you start your application, the default Node.js heap limit 1.4GB is used regardless how much memory your app is allocated, which might lead to improper auto-scaling decisions.<br/>

  A full sample of package.json:
  ```
  {
    "name": "Your-App",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "description": "A sample nodejs app for Bluemix",
    "scripts": {
      "start": "node -r bluemix-autoscaling-agent --max-old-space-size=600 app.js"
    },
    "dependencies": {
      "bluemix-autoscaling-agent": "*"
    },
    "repository": {},
    "engines": {
      "node": "0.12.x"
    } 
  }
  ``` 

## Configuring Swift apps with the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service
{: #swift-asagent}

To enable the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service with your Swift apps, besides service provision and binding steps, you need to complete the following steps as well before pushing the app to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

1. Update Package.swift file to add dependency declaration of package SwiftMetrics: 
   ```
   Package(url: "https://github.com/RuntimeTools/SwiftMetrics.git" , majorVersion: 1)
   ```
   A sample Package.swift file is as below: 
```
import PackageDescription
let package = Package(
    name: "Your-App",
    targets: [
      Target(name: "Your-App", dependencies: [])
    ],
    dependencies: [
      .Package(url: "https://github.com/RuntimeTools/SwiftMetrics.git" , majorVersion: 1)
    ]) 
```
2. Add the SwiftMetrics modules to your Swift app. 
 + Import the packages.
```   
import SwiftMetrics
import SwiftMetricsKitura
import SwiftMetricsBluemix
```
 + Initialize and start the agent: 
    +  Declare variables of the SwiftMetrics and SwiftMonitor in your app.
      ```   
      let sm: SwiftMetrics
      let monitor: SwiftMonitor
      ```
    +  Create instances of the SwiftMetrics and SwiftMonitor classes in your app.
      ```   
      sm = try SwiftMetrics()
      _ = SwiftMetricsKitura(swiftMetricsInstance: sm)
      _ = SwiftMetricsBluemix(swiftMetricsInstance: sm)
      monitor = sm.monitor()
      ```
    +  A sample of a Swift app that uses SwiftMetrics and Kitura is shown below:
      ```
      import Configuration
      import CloudFoundryConfig
      import Kitura
      import SwiftyJSON
      import Dispatch
      import LoggerAPI
      import CloudFoundryEnv
      import SwiftMetrics
      import SwiftMetricsKitura
      import SwiftMetricsBluemix
      import Foundation
      public class Controller {
          let router: Router
          let configMgr: ConfigurationManager
          var jsonEndpointEnabled: Bool = true
          var jsonEndpointDelay: UInt32 = 0

          // Declare variables of the SwiftMetrics and SwiftMonitor in your app
          let sm: SwiftMetrics
          let monitor: SwiftMonitor

          var port: Int {
              get { return configMgr.port }
          }
          var url: String {
              get { return configMgr.url }
          }
          init() throws {
              configMgr = ConfigurationManager().load(.environmentVariables)

              //Create instances of the SwiftMetrics and SwiftMonitor classes in your app
              sm = try SwiftMetrics()
              _ = SwiftMetricsKitura(swiftMetricsInstance: sm)
              _ = SwiftMetricsBluemix(swiftMetricsInstance: sm)
              monitor = sm.monitor()

              // All web apps need a Router instance to define routes
              router = Router()
              // Serve static content from "public"
              router.all("/", middleware: StaticFileServer())
              // Basic GET request
              router.get("/hello", handler: getHello)
          }
          
          public func getHello(request: RouterRequest, response: RouterResponse, next: @escaping () -> Void) throws {
              Log.debug("GET - /hello route handler...")
              response.headers["Content-Type"] = "text/plain; charset=utf-8"
              try response.status(.OK).send("Hello from Kitura-Starter!").end()
          }

      }
      ```

*Note:* Currently only Swift application using Kitura framework is supported to use {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service.

## Manage {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service through RESTful API 
{: #RESTAPI}

{{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} RESTful API provides an alternative way to manage {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service beside the Bluemix UI, and it also supports the scaling data retrieval and analysis. It provides similar functionalities, such as Creating a Policy and Getting the Scaling History, as in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} UI with API .

To use the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} RESTful API to manage the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service, complete the following prerequisites: Bind the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service with your application as specified in previous section, acquire the `AccessToken`, the URL of {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} API server and the `app_id` of the application that you want to scale in or out:

1. For security purpose, in each request header of {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} RESTful API, a proper `AccessToken` obtained through CloudFoundry UAA procedure must be provided in the `Authorization` header to indicate required validation of the request. Failing to comply with this `AccessToken` results in a 401 Unauthorized response. There are two ways you can get this `AccessToken` after you install the Cloud Foundry command line tool and logged into the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}:<ul><li>you can obtain this token through `cf oauth-token` command:
```
   > cf oauth-token
   Getting OAuth token...
   OK

     bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.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.nrzsEAZmGXNOWjX8r5Xf7U8Hj5-CE1rtHg8_C-jZKSk
```
 The returned long string begins with “bearer” is the AccessToken that can be used in the request of {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} RESTful API. If you encounter errors such as “Command not found”, you can update your Cloud Foundry command line tool to a newer version.</li><li>You can also find this AccessToken in the home directory. After you logged into {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} from the command line interface, a `.cf` folder is created in your home folder, where you can find a JSON file name `config.json`  that contains a list of the environment information of your current logging, such as organization, space, authentication endpoint and version. You can locate an entry `AccessToken` in the file as the following : 
```
   >cat ~/.cf/config.json
 {
  "ConfigVersion": 3,
  "Target": "https://api.ng.bluemix.net",
  "ApiVersion": "2.40.0",

  "LoggregatorEndPoint": "wss://loggregator.ng.bluemix.net:443",
  "DopplerEndPoint": "wss://doppler.ng.bluemix.net:443",
  "UaaEndpoint": "https://uaa.ng.bluemix.net",
  "RoutingApiEndpoint": "https://api.ng.bluemix.net/routing",
  "AccessToken": "bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.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.nrzsEAZmGXNOWjX8r5Xf7U8Hj5-CE1rtHg8_C-jZKSk",
  "SSHOAuthClient": "ssh-proxy",
 .....
 }
```
The `AccessToken` in the `config.json` only valid for a period of time. If you get a 401 Unauthorized response for REST API request, you might have to login in again from the command line interface to refresh the file and get the new `AcessToken`. </li></ul>
 
2.  You can obtain the URL of {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} API server by checking the `VCAP_SERVICE` environment variable after you bind your application with the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service. In the `VCAP_SERVICE`, you can find the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service section, and the `api_url` is the URL of API server that your application is bound with. You need this API server URL to connect to {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} RESTful API service:
```
    {
      "Auto-Scaling": [
      {
         "name": "Auto-Scaling-iw",
         "label": "Auto-Scaling",
         "plan": "free",
         "credentials": {
            "agentUsername": "agent",
            "api_url": "https://ScalingAPI.ng.bluemix.net",
            "service_id": "3f42b7ff-d939-4ff2-9a55-cb09cef9ab9e",
            "app_id": "2287f442-a7f3-4799-8919-d3908c386fa3",
            "url": "https://Scaling3.ng.bluemix.net",
            "agentPassword": "0cddf80b-37e1-4cfd-b648-83a6c8wee69f"
         }
      }
     ]
   }
``` 
Note that this url can also be found through the `cf env APPNAME` command:
```
   > cf env Hello
   Getting env variables for app Hello in org OE_Runtimes_SVT / space RT_SVT as Alice...
   OK

   System-Provided:
   {
     "VCAP_SERVICES": {
     "Auto-Scaling": [
     {
      "credentials": {
       "agentPassword": "b626b064-7d26-417a-b954-41c6d3cb5200",
       "agentUsername": "agent",
       "api_url": "https://ScalingAPI.ng.bluemix.net",
       "app_id": "aa8d19b6-eceb-4b6e-b034-926a87e98a51",
       "service_id": "8f482f78-58d8-493c-829b-635e4cbfd817",
       "url": "https://Scaling.ng.bluemix.net"
      },
      "label": "Auto-Scaling",
      "name": "ScalingService",
      "plan": "free",
      "tags": [
       "bluemix_extensions",
       "ibm_created",
       "dev_ops"
      ]
     }
   ...
```  
3.  You can get the `app_id` from the `VCAP_SERVICES` enviroment variable, or just run the `cf app APPNAME --guid` command:

```
   > cf app Hello --guid
   aa8d19b6-eceb-4b6e-b034-926a87e98a51
   > 
```

With all the above prerequisites, you can now make REST API request by using the RestClient add-on in browser or just through some tool like `curl`. 

With REST Client Add-on, like those for Firefox or Chrome, you can trigger REST request to {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} API server to execute your command. You just supply these add-on with the URL of the REST API, method and headers that are required by this REST API, and the parameters in the body part. For more details about each API, see [Rest API of IBM {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/apidocs/48){:new_window}.

With tools like `curl`, you can manage the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service within a script as following:    
```
    cf login -a http://api.ng.bluemix.net -u Alice -p pa55w0rd --skip-ssl-validation
    accessToken=$(cf oauth-token | grep bearer | sed -e s/bearer/Bearer/g)
    API_url=$(cf env Hello | grep "api_url" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d "," -f1 | cut -d "\"" -f2 )
    policyJson="./policy.json"
    appId=$(cf app Hello --guid)

    echo  -e "\nCreate scaling policy using API :"
    createPolicyUrl="${API_url}/v1/autoscaler/apps/${appId}/policy"
    curl_cmd="curl $createPolicyUrl -X 'PUT' -H 'Content-Type:application/json'  -H 'Accept:application/json' -H 'Authorization:$accessToken' --data-binary @${policyJson} -s -o response.txt -w '%{http_code}\n'"
    eval status_code=$($curl_cmd)
    if [[ $status_code -eq 201 ]]; then
         echo "looks good"
    else
         echo "error happens"
         exit 255
    fi
```

## Manage {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service through {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} CLI 
{: #CLI}

The {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} CLI provides similar functionality as {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} RESTful API but in a more friendly way to configure {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service. With {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} CLI you do not have to  care about the details in {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} RESTful API, such as `AccessToken` and URL of API server. All you need is just following the step by step directions that the CLI provides. For more details about how to install and use {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} CLI, see [{{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} CLI](../../cli/plugins/auto-scaling/index.html){:new_window}



## Policy fields for the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service
{: #policy_fields}

| Field name  | Description |
|-------------|----------------------|
|*Allowable maixmum instance count* | The maximum number of the application instance that can be started. If the current number of the application instances equals this value, the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service does not scale out the application any more. Default minimum instance count The minimum number of the application instance that can be started. If the number of the instances equals this value, the {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service dose not scale in the application any more. |
| *Metric Type* |   The supported metric types that can be monitored. For more information, see Table 2. |
| *Scale Out* |   Specifies the threshold that triggers a scaling out action and how many instances are increased when the scaling out action is triggered. |
| *Scale In* |  Specifies a threshold that triggers a scaling in action and how many instances are decreased when the scaling in action is triggered. |
| *Statistic Window* |  The length of the past period when received metric values are recognized as valid. Metric values are valid only if the time stamps fall within this period. The unit of the Statistic Window parameter is second. |
| *Breach Duration* | The length of the past period when a scaling action might be triggered. A scaling action is triggered when collected metric values are either above the upper threshold, or below the lower threshold longer than the time specified. The unit of the Breach Duration parameter is second. |
| *Cooldown period for scaling in* | After a scaling in action occurs, other scaling requests are ignored during the length of the period that is specified by the Cooldown period for scaling in parameter. The unit of this parameter is second. |
| *Cooldown period for scaling out* | After a scaling out action occurs, other scaling requests are ignored during the length of the period that is specified by the Cooldown period for scaling out parameter. The unit of this parameter is second. |
| *Time Zone* | The time zone where the schedule applies. |
| *Start Time*  | The start time of a recurring schedule. |

*Limitation:* To collect {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} metrics data, your application must be deployed as Liberty webapp so that measuring HTTP/HTTPS requests will be processed via Liberty web container.
For example, if you run a Spring Boot application as a "Main-Classs" app, the Liberty buildpack only provides java environment for you, and the app actually runs in the Spring embedded Tomcat container, thus no metrics data will be collected by the Auto-Scaling service. You must run your app as a Liberty WAR in order to work with Auto-Scaling service.<br/> 
*Limitation:* For Liberty application, only IBM JDK is supported for {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}}.<br/> 
*Limitation:* For Swift application, only Kitura framework is supported for {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}}.<br/>
